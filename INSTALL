1. Generate an RSA keypair (with passphrase) with openssl:

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 1024
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key

Don't forget to choose a passphrase when generating the private key.
This is the string you'll use for decoding your data.

2. Install the plugin:

python setup.py bdist_egg
... then copy dist/*.egg file into your plugin folder.

3. Configure your RSA keypair in your trac.ini:

[cryptdata]
private_key_path = /the/path/of/your/private.key
public_key_path = /the/path/of/your/public.key

4. Enjoy!
